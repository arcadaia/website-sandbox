      - title: High Precision Non-invasive electrical stimulation 
        content: Our lab is pioneering high-density non-invasive brain stimulation, a new approach that uses advanced electrode arrays to deliver highly focused and steerable electrical fields. Unlike conventional methods that spread current broadly, our technology allows us to precisely target specific brain regions and networks. This opens the door to safer, more effective ways of studying brain function and developing therapies for neurological and psychiatric conditions.
